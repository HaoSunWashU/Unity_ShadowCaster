# Unity_ShadowCaster
A Shader that can make the object invisible and let the object cast shadow in the same time

The Shader is named ShadowDrawer.shader in Unity_ShadowCaster/Shadow_map/Assets/Invisible Shadow Caster/

This Shader is from Keijiro Takahashi (a great unity developer in Unity Technologies Japan, https://github.com/keijiro)

Thanks to Keijiro.
